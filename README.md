## Apresentation
This game is played with a set of _Cards_ called _Deck_. The cards are created in a random way, with different levels of power and distinct specialities.
However, there are three _Elements_ that compounds every cards:

- __ü¶æ Impact:__ How _Strong_ it is
- __üèπ Precision:__ How _Accurate_ it is
- __üíÆ Enchant:__ How _Magic_ it is

_Duels_ consists of a strategic combat of cards seeking for more Points of Victories than your opponent.

## Decks
The Deck of a Card Master contains the following data:
  * The Cards you have (The Limit of cards you can possess is 30 cards)
  * The amount of Money (You start the game with 50 ‚Ñ≥ ).
  * Two Blank Duel Decks that referes the Cards you what to use in a Duel

## Cards and Elements
As it was said, Cards are formed for three elements of equal poder. But, there is a dominance order within the Elements:
- _Impact_ have advantage over _Precision_
- _Precision_ have advantage over _Enchant_
- _Enchant_ have advantage over _Impact_

All the Elements possess something called Elemental Award, activated ever you win a Round (This and what you will read now will be explained later):
- __Impact:__ In the next round, you receives +2d3 in the Element you choose as a Attacker/Defender
- __Precision:__ In the next round: If you are the Attack Duelist, you may choose three cards instead of two to be your Attack Front. In you are the Defense, you may choose two cards to show (Like the Attacker does), creating a Second-Defense-Fase after the Second-Attack-Fase
- __Enchant:__ In the next round: Before the First-Attack-Fase, you can choose a index of card that the opponent will not be able to use in this round

Besides the element, the cards are classified in 1 to 5 _Stars_. How higher the level, more powerfull the card is. There are three cards of 0 Stars. They are free and ever deck start with five of then:

Card|Impact|Precision|Enchant
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: 
Rock|1|0|0
Scissor|0|1|0
Paper|0|0|1
